## Features

- **Value Checking**: Verify if a given value matches `951`.
- **Automated Publishing**: Uses GitHub Actions to publish the package to NPM when a version tag is pushed.
- **Future-Proofing**: Includes a `.gitignore` for common npm artifacts like `node_modules`.

---

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install nine-five-one
```

---

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the package:

```javascript
const nineFiveOne = require('nine-five-one');

console.log(nineFiveOne(951)); // true
console.log(nineFiveOne(123)); // false
```

---

### Automation
The repository includes a **GitHub Actions workflow** that automates the publishing process:
1. When you push a **new version tag** (e.g., `v1.0.0`) to the repository:
   - The workflow automatically publishes the package to the NPM registry.
2. You no longer need to manually publish the package.

## About the `.gitignore`

The `.gitignore` file in this repository excludes:
- **`node_modules`**: Ensures that locally installed dependencies are not committed to the repository.
- While this package does not include dependencies at the moment, it is included for **future-proofing**, as most projects generate `node_modules` or other temporary files.
